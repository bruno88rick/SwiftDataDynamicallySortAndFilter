As things stand, just using @Query var users: [User] means SwiftData will load all the users with no filter or sort order, but really we want to customize one or both of those from ContentView â€“ we want to pass in some data. This is best done by passing a value into the view using an initializer, like above on init():*/

The underscore is Swift's way of getting access to that query, which means we're creating the query from whatever date gets passed in.*/
    /*This same approach works equally well with sorting data: we can control an array of sort descriptors in ContentView, then pass them into the initializer of UsersView to have them adjust the query.This uses Swift's generics again: the SortDescriptor type needs to know what it's sorting, so we need to specify User inside angle brackets. You can see on the initializer passing the Predicate Dinamically and the sort dinamucally too:*/
